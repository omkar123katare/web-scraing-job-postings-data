I have started looking for jobs for the role of a data analyst, to make my job hunt easy, I decided to scrape information about the job postings from the Indeed jobs website.
I wanted to know the current jobs market in this field. To get some insights, I have web scraped the Indeed jobs website for the post of Data Analyst.

This was a huge achievement as just by writing a few lines of code, I have created an excel file derived from pandas DataFrame that has the following information about 1705 job postings.

Data has the following features for each entry.
-Job role offered.
-Name of the company which is hiring.
-ratings given to the company by employees.
-Location of job.
-Time of Job posting.

For web scraping I have used beautifulsoup library and for accessing webpages I have used requests library.
